# üí´ About Me:
My name is Guillermo, but everyone calls me Willy. I am currently studying Computer Engineering at the Autonomous University of Madrid, specializing in English-Spanish programming. Alongside my university studies, I am also attending a cutting-edge programming school called 42 Madrid, which is considered one of the most innovative schools in the world.<br><br>In addition to my academic pursuits, I have several hobbies that I enjoy. One of my passions is scuba diving, exploring the depths of the ocean with a diving tank. It's a thrilling and serene experience that allows me to appreciate the wonders of marine life.<br><br>Another hobby of mine is 3D printing. I find it fascinating to create physical objects from digital designs, and it allows me to unleash my creativity and bring ideas to life. Whether it's designing prototypes or creating unique art pieces, 3D printing never fails to captivate me.<br><br>When I'm not diving or printing, you can often find me immersed in the world of video games. Gaming has been a long-standing interest of mine, and I enjoy exploring virtual worlds, solving puzzles, and engaging in multiplayer experiences. It's a fantastic way to relax and challenge myself mentally.
